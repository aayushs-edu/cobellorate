# Cobellorate
## Cobellorate is a collaborative group project manager.
#### Developed by Elliott Barringer, Aayush Sharma, and Shaunik Musukula - Sophomores at Bellarmine College Prep.
##### Cobellorate guides students through the process of creating, managing, and completing exceptional group projects. Students create projects, which function as shared directories. These projects have a multitude of features that empower students. Projects offer chat functionality, a system of push and pull requests, assignment due data syncing, and much more coming soon! The application is currently intended for students at Bellarmine College Preperatory, but nothing stops us from expanding.
